**MyPromptHive** is a self-hosted, local-first Prompt Management System designed for prompt engineers and AI enthusiasts. It allows you to organize, version, and text your LLM prompts in a beautiful, structured interface.

> 🧪 **Experiment Disclaimer**: This project is an experiment on the limits of "vibe coding". It was **completely vibe coded**, including all documentation, testing, and infrastructure configuration. No manual coding was performed.

## 📜 Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history of changes.

## 🚀 Comprehensive Feature Overview

### 📝 Core Prompt Management
*   **Rich Editor**: Syntax highlighting for variables and markdown support.
*   **Dynamic Variables**: Define variables like `{{topic}}` or `[[style]]` and auto-generate testing forms.
*   **Version Control**: Automatically track every change.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js 18+
*   npm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myprompthive.git
    cd myprompthive
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # and
    npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli # For doc generation
    ```

3.  **Running the Application**

    This project supports two environments: **Development** and **Production**.

    #### Option A: Development / Test
    *   **Port**: 3000
    *   **Database**: `data/dev.db`
    *   **Use for**: Coding, testing, and debugging.
    *   **Run it this way if you**: Are actively modifying code, debugging new features, or want to see changes update in real-time.
    *   **Pros**: Hot Reloading, Detailed Error Overlays, Easy Debugging.
    *   **Cons**: Slower performance, less strict than production environment.

    ```bash
    # 1. Initialize Database
    npx prisma db push

    # 2. Start Dev Server
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

    #### Option B: Production
    *   **Port**: 3100
    *   **Database**: `data/prod.db` (Separate stable database)
    *   **Use for**: Daily usage.
    *   **Run it this way if you**: Want to use the stable application locally with maximum performance and no container overhead, but don't plan to modify the code.
    *   **Pros**: Maximum Performance, Persistent Data (Separate DB), Stable.
    *   **Cons**: No Hot Reloading (requires restart for changes), harder to debug errors.

    ```bash
    # 1. Build the Application
    npm run build

    # 2. Initialize/Update Production Database
    npm run db:push:prod

    # ALTERNATIVE: Start with EMPTY database (Wipes existing data!)
    # npm run db:reset:prod

    # 3. Start Production Server
    npm run start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100).

    #### Option C: Docker (Production)
    Run the production build in an isolated container.

    *   **Run it this way if you**: Want a completely isolated, reproducible environment that mimics a real server deployment, or if you want to run the app in the background without worrying about local Node.js version conflicts.
    *   **Pros**: Complete Isolation, Consistent Environment, Easy Deployment/Migration.
    *   **Cons**: Requires Docker, slightly more complex setup (volume mounting), harder to access internal files directly.

    ```powershell
    # 1. Build the Image
    docker build -t myprompthive-production .

    # 2. Prepare Data Directory
    # Create a 'data' folder in your project root to persist the database.
    # The container will look for /app/data/prod.db
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path data

    # 3. Run Container
    # Maps local 'data' folder to container storage
    # Uses docker.env for default configuration (Update this file or use .env.production for real secrets)
    docker run -d -p 3100:3000 --name prompthive `
      -v ${PWD}/data:/app/data `
      -v ${PWD}/public/uploads:/app/public/uploads `
      --env-file docker.env `
      myprompthive-production
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100).

### ⚙️ Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration.
*   `docker.env`: Included in the repo with default values for easy testing.
*   `.env.production`: (Ignored by Git) Create this file for secure production deployments to override secrets.
*   `admin.properties`: Contains the password to grant yourself admin rights.

**Note on Ignored Files:**
*   `data/*.db`: SQLite databases are ignored to prevent sharing your personal data. They are automatically initialized when you run the setup commands.
*   `public/uploads/*`: User uploads are ignored. The folder structure is preserved.

## Why did I make it?

I built MyPrompthive because I needed a better way to manage my growing collection of prompts. I wanted something that could store prompts efficiently on my own infrastructure, without being locked into any particular AI model or provider. Most existing solutions either lived in the cloud (where I had less control), were tightly coupled to specific APIs, or lacked essential features like proper version history, a flexible folder structure for organization, variable substitution, and attachment support. But equally important was security: I needed a system that could completely decouple prompt management from API credentials. With kids in the house who are naturally curious about AI, I wanted to prevent scenarios where they could accidentally rack up tens of euros in token costs by having access to my API keys. Promthive is that solution: a self-hosted, model-agnostic prompt library that puts organization, security, and cost control first.
